# Polynomial Regression Salary Predictor

This project demonstrates how to build a Polynomial Regression model in Python to predict employee salary based on years of experience. It satisfies the assignment requirements to:

- Load and visualize data
- Fit and compare Linear and Polynomial Regression models
- Predict salary for given years of experience
- Provide clear, easy-to-execute instructions

---

## üìÇ Files Included

- `salary_data.csv` ‚Äî Dataset with "YearsExperience" and "Salary" columns.
- `polynomial_regression_salary_predictor.py` ‚Äî Executable Python script that:
  - Loads and plots the data
  - Fits both Linear and Polynomial Regression
  - Compares models visually
  - Predicts salary for user-provided experience

---

##  How to Run

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies:
2Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure `salary_data.csv` is in the same folder.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the script:
The program will:

‚úÖ Show a scatterplot of the data.  
‚úÖ Plot Linear and Polynomial Regression curves.  
‚úÖ Predict salary for a sample (e.g., 6.5 years).  
‚úÖ Allow the user to input custom experience values for prediction.

---

## ‚úÖ Notes

- Default polynomial degree is 4 (modifiable in code).  
- CSV headers assumed: `YearsExperience,Salary`.  
- Edit column names in the script if your CSV is different.
